## Project Description

This project builds a machine learning web application to predict health insurance charges based on personal and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, sex, and residential region. Using a Random Forest regression model trained on a real-world insurance dataset, the app provides users with instant, personalized cost estimates. Additionally, it offers actionable suggestions to help users optimize their lifestyle for reduced insurance expenses. The app is built with Streamlit, enabling an interactive and user-friendly interface for real-time predictions and insights.
